                "I gained so so much from my experience abroad. I do not regret it, and would undeniably do it again. I gained a lot of important skills from my internship that I can use for future jobs. I was exposed to so many different career options and the things I've learned from my courses and from meeting people helped me to make major... Hannah Lee - Brandeis University View Entire Review",

                "It was definitely worthwhile. I gained a lot from the internship, on how to work, what to do, how to deal with conflicts, how do NGO's work and how does a successful NGO work to make the work be fun. A student - Trinity University View Entire Review",
                "I made my experience in Geneva great on my own accord. The program did not contribute to my wonderful time in Geneva. I learned a lot about Swiss history and enjoyed exploring the country. Irene M - Trinity University View Entire Review",

                "I learned that I do not want to work in the public health sector, but instead want to focus more on neuroscience. While in hindsight I would not have gone on this program because I would've liked to focus more on neuroscience research, this experience allowed me to learn more about myself and my future career path.

I have a job because of this program, but BU needs to make some serious administrative changes before anyone is able to enjoy this experience. Logan N - Brandeis University View Entire Review",

                "One of the biggest take-aways from this program that has fundamentally changed my worldview is just how much of an impact the United States has had on the world and how (often unknowingly) privileged Americans are simply by holding a US passport. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "I tried my best to get to know the locals. Swiss people are very private, so it took me a long time to make friends with them. However, this gave me less time to hang out with the Americans in my program, and made them dislike me. They started to talk behind me. I've learnt that you can't have your cake and eat it. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "I learned a lot from the internship, which was probably the most worthwhile part of the whole thing. I also became a really good traveler and had an amazing time traveling Europe. Switzerland is also a place I would consider living in the future. The only part that soured the whole thing was the way that the program was run. Morgan G - Bucknell University View Entire Review",

A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",

                "I learned what it was like working in the international relations field which is somewhere I definitely do not see myself in the future. I'm glad I had the experience, but I now know that I'd rather work for an NGO doing field work than doing policy work. Sigrid S - Brandeis University View Entire Review",

                "My experience abroad was extremely valuable and I learned so much about wonderful Middle Eastern culture and history. I think Amman is the best place to immerse yourself in Arabic because of the dialect and location but it isn't necessarily the most exciting.

                "The experience was definitely life-changing. The learning curve is immense. I felt like I learned so much about South Africa but I know for a fact that I've barely even scraped the surface. The country has an incredibly rich culture and history-- the plethora of information you gather in a day is mindblowing. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "I made lasting friendships, learned a lot from local students. It was absolutely worthwhile because South Africa is an amazing country. Natalia Marques - Wellesley College View Entire Review",
                "I learned about racial relations in contexts out side of the US that, although I thought I understood previously, I realized I didn't fully get before. I was given a non-western perspective for the first time and was able to question things that I had blindly accepted before. Emilia B - Wellesley College View Entire Review",
                "I learned a lot about what it means to be a woman of color in a world that is not safe for women with my racial identity. Cape Town is not an easy place to be for women of color (no cities really are honestly) and I really did learn a lot about myself during this time. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "I learned about many different cultures and it was very worthwhile. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "A real sense of worldly perspective. The protests did make me think about the education systems of South Africa and the US, as well as how systemic racism differs between the two countries. The concepts were complex and interesting, and the conversations I had were incredibly worthwhile. Alex McGlue - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "A greater sense of independence and a more worldly paradigm. A student - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "My semester in Cape Town was amazing and definitely too fast. A lot of people say that abroad changes you but I think that it really just makes you a better version of yourself. Olivia R - Brandeis University View Entire Review",
                "I learned so much studying abroad in a place that isn't so mainstream. It was the fastest 5 months of my life and I learned a lot about a country I had never really thought about. Kate Beispel - The University of Texas at Austin View Entire Review",

                "I learned a lot about race and poverty but more than anything I learned a lot about the US which was surprising. I will have to do a lot of self-reflection when I return but I definitely am a changed person and I enjoy where I am with myself in life right now.

                "I gained some new language skills in French. I also have an enhanced perspective on the world in places like Europe and southern Africa. My lessons to learn were learned and the spent time in foreign places was totally worthwhile. Alexander Lamothe - University of Hartford View Entire Review",
                "I learned a lot about myself and what it means to be a black person in western spaces. It was also so great to be in a place where the curriculum is afro centered and the faculty black. It was worth it. A student - Wellesley College View Entire Review",
                "The experience was worthwhile and the exchange rate made it an affordable option in comparison to a lot of programs in Europe A student - Wellesley College View Entire Review",
                "This program is both enjoyable and teaches you about both the physical, geographical beauty of South Africa and its history, both in terms of notable South African people and of apartheid and decolonization. Also, definitely would recommend for animal lovers as there are many beautiful animals in South Africa! Ariella R - University of Hartford View Entire Review",
                "I learned that we live in a globalised society, that colonialism is still happening and its effects are devastating. I learned how different economies, systems of education and political structures function. I was very worthwhile and I'm so glad I went. A student - Berea College View Entire Review",

                "I learned so much, but some of the main lessons were how to be more tolerant, how to be more independent, encouragement to always try new things, and just generally about Cape Town's culture. A student - Middlebury College View Entire Review",
                "I gained a new love for adventure and to get up and want to make the most of everyday. There is so much to do in Cape Town and I thoroughly took advantage of all of the opportunities. It is also historically incredibly interesting (and depressing at times) which makes for a culture that is unlike anywhere else in the world. A student - Middlebury College View Entire Review",

I had some world class professors, second-to-none, but going from Wellesley (small school, nice profs who care, etc.) to a large public university with your entire grade based off of one paper, was challenging.

It was my second time doing a study abroad program in Copenhagen and I didn't know I would continue to learn so much more about the city and Danish culture.

                "I gained an understanding and confidence in myself. I learned more about myself in 6 months abroad than in 3 years in University. I know I can overcome certain obstacles. A student - The University of Texas at Austin View Entire Review",
                "My study abroad experience was extremely worthwhile. It helped me to figure out a lot of things about myself and about my wants and desires. Traveling to another country and being immersed in a foreign culture will make you re-evaluate yourself and your world-view. It is an invaluable experience.

There's so much beauty out there that we never take the time to look at and we should. It was the best experience of my life so far and I can't wait to travel again. A student - The University of Texas at Austin View Entire Review",

                "This was one of the greatest decision I have ever made and definitely worthwhile. I liked doing it my second semester junior year because it got me excited about going back to Texas for one more year and gave me a break.
